can we adjust orders after that
cancel

can they use tablets

So we were just in contact with the owners and they had few questions:

1. In the past, they were able to adjust orders after they were made. For example, when an order comes in, they were able to charge more for special requests. Would that be possible with Chowly?

2. I understand Chowly does not get cancellation info from third parties. So how would businesses know when orders to get cancelled. Could you maybe explain how the process would work if a customer does cancel?

3. Some businesses are currently using the tablets supplied by the third parties. Would they be able to continue to use the tablets while using Chowly's services?

Thanks!
